This github repository houses the tutorial written for Moltin's iOS SDK along with sample code. Please go to the `Tutorial` folder for the tutorial (obviously) and the `Source Code` folder for the sample app written in Swift 3.

##Agenda
The tutorial is divided into two parts: 

1. Set up a moltin web store
2. Build a shopping app with Moltin's iOS SDK

I strongly recommend you sign up for a free account at [Moltin](https://www.moltin.com) and follow along.
